### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was also one of my favorite labs as we programmed a guessing game. Here we learned how do-while loops can be so effective. The program had the ability to repeat and also learned how to use absolute value to maintain having positive numbers. This lab was also pretty fun to complete.


* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was one of my favorite labs as it was not only unique at the time, but also challenged us more. In this lab we utilized calling functions multiple times to get the expected output. We also implemented the try-catch operation for the first time, which helped us eliminate errors from occurring.

* Lab 7

    Lab 10, part 3 was also one of my favorite labs where we learned how to display or output color within a .png file. We also utilized other files to check if their file extension was the same, otherwise we had an error return statement. This lab was also very interesting as we utilized the Magick library.
